#32-bit MIPS Processor Design (VHDL)
##Overview
This project implements a fully functional 32-bit MIPS-style microprocessor using VHDL, designed to support memory access, R-type, and I-type instructions.
The processor includes custom datapath components, a memory module with memory-mapped I/O, and a multi-stage control unit for instruction execution.
Development, simulation, and synthesis were performed using Intel Quartus Prime.

The design emphasizes modularity, extensibility, and simulation validation through waveform analysis.
